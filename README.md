PPG &amp; ECG Annotation Tool

PPG & ECG Annotation Tool is a software tool for the annotation of multimodal recordings of electrocardiography and photoplethysmography signals. The software allows three classes of annotations: fiducial points, arrhythmic events, and signal quality. The tool includes algorithms for automatic fiducial points detection in both signals and allows manual correction by the user. Also, the software contains tools for measuring time intervals and heart rates in selected segments. The intended audience of the software is researchers and cardiologists, it does not require programming skills, and the user interface is straightforward and intuitive. The software is written in Python and is available for Windows and Linux platforms.
